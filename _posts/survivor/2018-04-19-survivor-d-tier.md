# Ranking the Seasons of Survivor
This is a list of every season of survivor with a short and mostly spoiler free summary and why/when you might want to watch it. This is intended as a guide for those who are new to Survivor or those who are unfamiliar with every season, which is likely for the general population considering there's over 500 episodes. This is also for super fans, like myself, who have seen every (or almost every) season and are curious as to how their opinions line up with my own.
## D Tier
### 30: Marquesas (Season 4)
This season struggled in the casting department more than anything else; one castaway auditioned for a later season and made it to the second round of interviews before anybody even realized he was already on the show. One of the challenges consisted of the castaways making and flying kites...COOL! Nothing in this season is *that* terrible, but nothing is *that* interesting either. 

**Watch When:** You've exhausted your other options. 
### 29: Worlds Apart (Season 30) 
Worlds Apart starts out strong, but it gradually just gets worse and worse until it's over and then you can't even remember one cool thing that happened all season long. Don't let the amount of castaways that returned for seasons after this one fool you: one of the castaways was fantastic and played a very memorable second season, but all the others that came back were just as dull their second season as they were in this season. The winner was better than most of the other contestants, but there's a reason why castaways who are physically dominant almost never win, because they're too one-dimensional to have played a game worth winning. 

**Watch When:** You want to watch a relatively new season with a cast that is completely new and somewhat interesting. 
### 28: Heroes vs. Healers vs. Hustlers (Season 35)
This was the first season I watched with an entirely new cast after a long Survivor hiatus, so my expectations may have been a little too high. This was a pretty good cast on paper, but wow did they suck at the game of Survivor. They all knew how to play the game, but when it came time to execute their moves, they just fell flat. It was like watching a group of middle schoolers play basketball in gym class when they had never actually played before...like their coach tells them "you have to dribble the ball' and then they just run down the court with the ball in their hands and act confused when they're told they did the wrong thing. That's what this season felt like. 

**Watch When:** You want to see a really new season I guess. 
### 27: Gabon (Season 17) 
Yet another season with an underwhelming cast; some contestants from this season came back, but none of the ones that fans actually wanted to see, ones that people would have forgotten entirely had they not returned for a second season. Luckily this season allowed producers to realize that they needed to stop filming in Africa because the region just doesn't work with the show. That being said, Gabon isn't all bad, there are some enjoyable characters and some who play very compelling games. There's just more bad than there is good. 

**Watch When:** You're trying to see all the seasons and you haven't seen this one yet. 
### 26: Africa (Season 3)
Africa's cast had some very likable characters who deserved to be on reality tv and just as many duds who didn't. My biggest problem with this season is the location; when the premise of Survivor came out, they had to go to Africa you know, birthplace of humanity, lions and tigers and all that. However, it's not that enjoyable to watch people up all day and night like "holy shit I might get eaten by a lion!" and then not get eaten by a lion. Like...let somebody die or don't go there in the first place. 

**Watch When:** You haven't seen All Stars yet and you want to get to know some of the characters on that season. Or when you want to see one of the OG seasons.
