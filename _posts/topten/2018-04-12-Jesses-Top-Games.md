I am positive that bias towards the games that I grew up with has a lot to do with this list.  Abandoning that subjective view makes top ten lists irrelevant, though.

**10. Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock**

Guitar Hero is a franchise that I can keep coming back to over and over again and somehow never get tired of.  This is because of two reasons in particular.  The feeling of accomplishment I get when I *finally* beat that song I have been trying to beat forever (Raining Blood, you son of a bitch), and it is easy to tell that when I'm getting better at it.  When I start to consistently hit a string of notes that I usually have trouble with, I know that I am getting better.  I chose Guitar Hero III because, lets be honest, it is without a doubt THE Guitar Hero game.  It has the perfect balance of playability and song choices.  I still play this game frequently, and I don't plan on stopping anytime soon.

**9. Super Mario Sunshine**

This game is one of the games that I think of when I think about playing video games as a kid.  It has all the charm of a classic Mario game, but it also has so much more.  It's easy enough to run through the game and just beat it, but getting all 120 stars, forget about it (for me anyway).  Not only are the levels fun, but it's also fun to just slide around the island and parkour onto things you didn't know whether you could get onto or not.  Along with Super Mario 64 and Super Mario Bros. 3, Super Mario Sunshine is in my S-Tier of Mario platformers, and it will always have a special place in my heart.

**8. Tony Hawk's American Wasteland**

This is the first video game that I got in trouble for playing too much.  The best soundtrack of any Tony Hawk game (fight me). With songs like California Uber Alles, Sonic Reducer, and Rise Above, this game was my introduction to the world of punk music.  It also had killer songs like What's Up Fatlip.  I still remember running into my living room and hurridly asking my mom if she knew where the game manual was.  She asked me why I needed it and I said "I need to learn how to grind!"  She burst into laughter thinking that I meant grinding in the dancing sense.  This is the ultimate "I want to fuck around for a few hours" game.  *Hey hey! Ho ho! The use of wool has got to go!*

**7. Minecraft**

Without a doubt, I have spent more time playing Minecraft than any other game ever.  I would even say that I have played it twice as much as my second most played game.  I may have also watched more hours of YouTube videos of other people playing Minecraft than I have played any other games. I have friends now that I am certain I would have never met if I never played Minecraft with them.  Minecraft also introduced me to programming through ComputerCraft, now I am about to graduate with a degree in CS.  I am a firm believe that this game makes you more creative and helps build interpersonal relationships.  Minecraft is exceptionally liberating, whether you want to build an entire functioning factory, build a massive treehouse, or just blow things up because it's funny.

**6. Portal 2**

I was late to the Valve party by several years.  I didn't know what Orange Box was until 2013.  I love puzzles, and the Portal franchise satisfies my puzzle craving better than any game out there.  Portal 2 has a step up on the original because the co-op is just sooooo much fun.  Solving puzzles by yourself is fun, but building bonds with someone while spending hours upon hours tredging through testing area after testing area cannot be beat.

**5. Infamous**

Infamous is the only game that I have played all the way through just to go back and immediately do it again.  I went through my first playthrough doing all of the good things I could.  When I got to the end, my ignorant 14 year old self saw that I could get a bunch of power by exploding the thing at the end.  What I didn't realize is that it would give me IRREVERSIBLE EVIL KARMA.  I can still feel my heart skip a beat when I think about that.  So as soon as I realized there was no gaining my goo karma back, I played again doing the exact opposite thing.  Both storylines are incredibly fun, and the gameplay mechanics are incredible.  Some of the choices you have to make are actually really tough.  It is genuinely hard to tell when you are making the \*right\* choice.

**4. Undertale**

Toby Fox is a genius.  I *dispise* turn based games, and this game is one of my favorite games of all time.  The music is amazing, the characters are extremely lovable, and the jokes are actually hilarious.  It's hard to qualify why I love this game so much in words.

**3. Super Smash Bros. Melee**

Super Smash Bros. Melee is the craziest game to ever exist in my opinion.  For a game that is 17 YEARS OLD, it still somehow has all of the charm it had during its release.  The amount of technical skill it takes to be genuinely good at this game is insane, and I know I will never get to that point, no matter how badly I wish I could.  The fact that people are still finding new ways to play the game is incredible.  It is the perfect game for playing with your friends for fun and/or for competition.  I don't care what anybody says, this is the best fighting game of all time and always will be.

**2. Last of Us**

Best. Story. Ever.  Last of Us should be the golden standard for how to tell a story through a game.  Not many games had me as invested in the characters as this one did.  Last of Us also made me learn how to play stealthily instead of going head first into a crowd of enemies and trying to take them out.  I have beaten this game on every difficulty, and I am considering buying a new playstation just so I can play the new one when it comes out, and that's a big deal for me.

**1. Skyrim**

Skyrim. I didn't buy this game until 2015, and wow.  I was immediately addicted.  There is so much to do, and you can do it however you want.  I played through my first time ignorant of how Elder Scrolls games go and went straight through the campaign.  I though "wow I suck at video games."  Once I realized that I can become OP before I even progress the story at all changed the game for me.  My favorite part of the game is that I can play extremely inconventionally, and still make it work.  It's super fun to play as a stealth archer and just destroy anyone you see before they even know you're there.  It's fun to play as a glass cannon mage and try to blow people up with traps.  It's fun to play with a shield and a mace and just run in and see what happens.  Skyrim is just fun.  Period.
