I am positive that bias towards the games that I grew up with has a lot to do with this list.  Abandoning that subjective view makes top ten lists irrelevant, though.

**10. Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock**

**9. Super Mario Sunshine**

**8. Tony Hawk's American Wasteland**

**7. Minecraft**

**6. Portal 2**

**5. Infamous**

**4. Undertale**

**3. Super Smash Bros. Melee**

**2. Last of Us**

**1. Skyrim**
